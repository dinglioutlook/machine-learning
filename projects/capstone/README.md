# Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree
## Introduction
Traditional machine learning models may not work well on unbalanced data. Such as in our cases, the data are 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions, that is the positive class account for 0.172% of all transactions. The possibile solution are outlier detection or balance data. Scikit-learn offers imbedded solutions of [outlier detection](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/outlier_detection.html) and [inbalanced learn](http://contrib.scikit-learn.org/imbalanced-learn/stable/).  The projet goal is to compare those models and analysis the root cause behind.

## Data
The data is too big to upload at github, please download the [credit card dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/data) here.

## Environment:
The experiement are based on python 3.6, all requirements can be found [here](requirements.txt), and notebook at [here](credit_card_fraud_detection.ipynb)

## Note from Udacity

The Capstone is a two-staged project. The first is the proposal component, where you can receive valuable feedback about your project idea, design, and proposed solution. This must be completed prior to your implementation and submitting for the capstone project. 

You can find the [capstone proposal rubric here](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/410/view), and the [capstone project rubric here](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/108/view). Please ensure that you are following directions correctly before submitting these two stages which encapsulate your capstone.

Please email [machine-support@udacity.com](mailto:machine-support@udacity.com) if you have any questions.
